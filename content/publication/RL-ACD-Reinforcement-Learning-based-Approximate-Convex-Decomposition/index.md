abstract: "Approximate Convex Decomposition (ACD) aims to approximate complex 3D shapes with convex components, which is widely applied to create compact collision representations for real-time applications. Unfortunately, existing methods either produce suboptimal results due to greedy heuristics, or incur prohibitive computational costs by relying on exhaustive search strategies. In this work, we propose RL-ACD, a data-driven, reinforcement learning-based approach for efficient and near-optimal convex shape decomposition."
